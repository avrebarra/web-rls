# Web-RLS (Realtime Location Sharing)
Realtime location sharing made with Node, Express, ReactJS, and Socket.io

See working copy at: https://web-rls.herokuapp.com/

## How to try
For the first draft version: 
1. Open the working copy on two or more different tabs/windows (it can be on different device)
2. Write the same room name
3. Experiment it! (Try changing the name, the room, and overriding location using developer tools)

## Issues
* Compatibility issue on some mobile browsers

## Web-RLS (Realtime Location Sharing using WebSocket)
Realtime location sharing made with Node, Express, ReactJS, and Socket.io **that is built without using any database**

See working app at: https://web-rls.herokuapp.com/ (hosted on heroku free gear)

### Motivation
In this experiment, I'm trying to make a location sharing app that could function rightly **without relying on any databases**. The whole stack is build using Web Technology. All sharing mechanism is done by using WebSocket transfer mechanism (build over Socket.IO API). At last, it is done and proven to be working pretty well.

### Stacks Used
In this project these stacks are used:
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- SocketIO
- Google Map React Component

### How to use
For the first draft version: 
1. Open the app on two or more different tabs/windows (it can be on different device)
2. Write the same room name
3. Experiment on it! (Try changing the name, the room, and overriding location using developer tools)

### Issues
* Compatibility issue on some mobile browsers

### Something is Missing?
If you have ideas for more that should be on this app or documentation, [let us know](https://github.com/shrotavre/web-rls/issues) or contribute some!
